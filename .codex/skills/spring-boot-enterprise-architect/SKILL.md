# Spring Boot Enterprise Architect

Use this skill for planning, reviewing, scaffolding, or implementing Spring Boot backend applications. Keep the work backend-focused and preserve the user's chosen deployment style. Do not introduce microservices, gateways, composite services, or external providers unless the user requests them or the domain boundaries clearly require them.

## Architecture boundaries

Prefer a strict dependency direction:

```text
Resource/Controller -> Service -> Facade -> Repository -> Database
```

- Resource/controller layer owns HTTP routing, request validation, OpenAPI annotations, API versioning, and response envelopes. It must not contain business rules or repository calls.
- Service layer owns business workflows, authorization orchestration, password/session workflows, and transactions. It should not call repositories directly when the project uses a facade boundary.
- Facade layer is the persistence gateway. It coordinates repository access, mapping to entities, tenant/user context, and cross-repository operations.
- Repository layer uses Spring Data interfaces and query specifications. Keep query construction out of resources and services.
- Use MapStruct at explicit boundaries. Do not expose JPA entities directly from the API.

For projects using a `resources` package, define resource contracts and implementations there. Resource methods should accept request models and return `StandardResponse<T>` or `StandardResponse<PageResponse<T>>`. Keep request and response models separate where security or field visibility differs.

## API contracts

Use `/api/v1` versioning and document endpoints with `@Tag`, `@Operation`, and meaningful `@ApiResponse` annotations.

The project shared kernel uses:

```java
StandardResponse<T>
PageResponse<T>
```

Preserve the envelope fields already defined by the project (`data`, `message`, `error`, `timestamp`, and `httpStatus`). Do not replace the project type with a second response wrapper without an explicit migration decision.

For paginated APIs, return `StandardResponse<PageResponse<T>>`. Include page number, page size, total records, total pages, and a list of results. Validate page size limits and reject negative page values.

Never include password hashes, reset tokens, refresh tokens, or internal security metadata in response models. Use dedicated request/response models such as `CreateUserRequest`, `LoginRequest`, `UserResponse`, and `TokenResponse`.

For password login, accept one `identifier` plus `password`. The identifier may be a username, email address, or phone number. Normalize identifiers consistently before lookup, enforce uniqueness at the database level, and return the same authentication failure shape for all identifier types.

## Persistence and domain modeling

- Use UUID primary keys for distributed-safe identifiers.
- Put shared persistence fields in abstract `@MappedSuperclass` types.
- Use `@Version` for optimistic locking.
- Define explicit table and column names, indexes, and unique constraints for login identifiers.
- Initialize JPA collections with mutable implementations such as `HashSet`, never immutable `Set.of()` values.
- Map many-to-many relationships with explicit join tables and avoid recursive entity serialization.
- Keep validation on request models where possible; use entity validation for invariants that must hold regardless of entry point.
- Use `JpaSpecificationExecutor` for dynamic search, filtering, and sorting rather than adding an unbounded number of repository methods.

## Auditing

For audit fields:

1. Extend an abstract `@MappedSuperclass`.
2. Add `@EntityListeners(AuditingEntityListener.class)`.
3. Enable auditing with `@EnableJpaAuditing`.
4. Register an `AuditorAware<String>` or `AuditorAware<UUID>` bean.
5. Resolve the authenticated principal from `SecurityContextHolder`; use an explicit system identity for scheduled/system writes.

Keep date auditing (`createdDate`, `lastModifiedDate`) separate from application-managed soft-delete fields (`deletedDate`, `deletedBy`). Audit fields do not require custom exceptions.

## Multi-tenancy

When using Hibernate discriminator-based tenancy:

- Mark the entity tenant field with `@TenantId`.
- Resolve the current tenant from trusted request/authentication context, not an arbitrary body field.
- Store tenant context in a request-scoped or carefully cleared `ThreadLocal`.
- Clear the context in a `finally` block after every request.
- Fail closed when no tenant is present; never silently use a default tenant.
- Validate that a tenant header matches the authenticated token or principal before allowing access.
- Register Hibernate's `CurrentTenantIdentifierResolver` and test repository access across two tenants.

`@TenantId` sets the entity value and participates in tenant filtering; it is not a complete authorization policy by itself.

## Soft delete and active state

Soft delete must be explicit and consistent. A delete operation should set deletion metadata and inactive state, while restore should reverse it according to authorization rules.

Do not assume `isDeleted` and `isActive` automatically filter repository results. Implement repository specifications, Hibernate filters, or service-level query policies. Define different visibility rules for ordinary users, managers, and administrators, and test each role.

## Authentication and sessions

- Store only BCrypt/Argon2 password hashes; never log or return raw passwords.
- Issue short-lived access tokens and longer-lived refresh tokens.
- Rotate refresh tokens on every refresh and invalidate the previous token.
- Store refresh/session state and token revocation data in Redis when Redis is part of the architecture.
- On logout, invalidate the refresh token and blacklist the access-token JTI until its expiry.
- If concurrent sessions are limited, store device/session metadata and enforce the configured eviction or rejection policy atomically.
- Password reset tokens must be cryptographically random, short-lived, single-use, and invalidated after reset. Invalidate existing sessions after a password reset.
- Add OAuth2/social login only when requested; link external identities by provider subject, not email alone.

## RBAC and authorization

Model role precedence explicitly rather than relying only on role names. A typical hierarchy is:

```text
ADMIN > SUBADMIN > MODERATOR > MANAGER > CUSTOMER_SUPPORT > USER
```

Enforce authorization at multiple relevant boundaries:

- Method-level security for endpoint permissions.
- Service/facade checks for ownership and role precedence.
- Specifications for filtering query results.

Do not trust a path variable such as `/users/{id}` to prove ownership. Verify the authenticated principal, tenant, target owner, and role permissions before reading or mutating data.

## Modular monoliths and microservices

Start with a modular monolith when domain boundaries, deployment independence, or scale requirements are not established. Use separate modules for shared kernel and domain capabilities, and avoid leaking domain internals through the shared module.

Introduce microservice infrastructure only when justified:

- Eureka or another registry for service discovery.
- Spring Cloud Gateway for routing, centralized JWT verification, CORS, and rate limiting.
- Composite/BFF services for deliberate read aggregation or write orchestration; consult the user before adding one.
- Kafka for asynchronous events and sagas when synchronous transactions cannot cross service boundaries safely.

## Configuration and operations

- Keep global configuration in `application.yaml` and environment-specific values in profile files.
- Never commit database, Redis, OAuth, payment, or messaging credentials. Use environment variables or a secret manager.
- Keep dev/test integrations such as MailHog, SMSHog, mock payment webhooks, and local brokers behind profiles.
- Use `ddl-auto: validate` outside disposable development databases and prefer migrations for shared environments.
- Add rate limiting for authentication, password reset, OTP, and other abuse-sensitive endpoints.
- Verify payment webhook signatures before changing payment state.

## Implementation workflow

1. Clarify modular monolith versus distributed services.
2. Identify bounded contexts and module dependencies.
3. Define roles, precedence, ownership, and tenant rules.
4. Define request/response contracts and standardized error handling.
5. Model entities, constraints, audit fields, tenant fields, and repositories.
6. Implement facades, then services, then resource/controller implementations.
7. Add authentication, sessions, filters/specifications, and rate limiting.
8. Add focused unit, repository, security, tenant-isolation, and API tests.
9. Verify configuration, generated mappings, migration behavior, and startup before expanding scope.

## Review checklist

- No resource/controller directly calls a repository.
- No service bypasses the facade boundary where the architecture requires facades.
- All API responses use the shared generic response envelope.
- Request and response models do not leak secrets.
- Login supports the intended identifier types consistently.
- Tenant context is trusted, required, cleared, and tested.
- Audit dates and principals are populated for authenticated and system writes.
- Soft-deleted records are excluded or included deliberately by role.
- Unique constraints and normalization prevent duplicate login identifiers.
- Secrets are externalized and profile configuration is complete.
